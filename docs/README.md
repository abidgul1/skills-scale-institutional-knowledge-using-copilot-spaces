# Welcome to OctoAcme's Project Management Documentation 👋

Welcome to the central hub for OctoAcme's project management processes! This documentation is designed to help new team members, stakeholders, and contributors quickly understand how we plan, execute, and deliver projects successfully.

## 📘 Overview

At OctoAcme, we follow a **customer-first, iterative approach** to project delivery. Our process emphasizes:

- **Clear ownership and accountability** - Every project has dedicated Project Managers and Product Leads
- **Iterative delivery** - We ship small, testable increments to deliver value quickly
- **Data-informed decisions** - We measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety** - We encourage open feedback, learning, and continuous improvement
- **Quality assurance** - Testing, security, and observability are built into our workflow

## 🔄 Project Lifecycle

Our projects follow a structured lifecycle from idea to deployment:

1. **Initiation** - Validate the business need, align stakeholders, and create a project charter
2. **Planning** - Break down work, estimate scope, identify dependencies, and create release plans
3. **Execution** - Build, test, review, and iterate with daily standups and weekly syncs
4. **Release** - Deploy to production with proper testing, rollback plans, and announcements
5. **Retrospective** - Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements

## 👥 Key Roles and Personas

Our cross-functional teams include:

- **Project Managers (PM)** - Coordinate delivery, manage schedules, risks, and communications
- **Product Managers (PdM)** - Define outcomes, prioritize the backlog, and measure success
- **Developers** - Implement features, collaborate on design, and maintain quality
- **QA/Testing** - Validate quality standards and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders** - Provide inputs, feedback, and approvals

For detailed responsibilities and communication patterns, see our [Roles and Personas Guide](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md).

## 💬 Communication Strategies

We maintain transparency and alignment through:

- **Weekly syncs** between PM and Product leads
- **Daily standups** for delivery teams (15 minutes, focused on progress and blockers)
- **Monthly stakeholder updates** with key metrics and milestones
- **Risk registers** and decision logs maintained by Project Managers
- **Ad-hoc escalations** following clear escalation paths when needed

## ✅ Quality Assurance Practices

Quality is embedded throughout our development process:

- **Automated testing** - Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end smoke tests
- **Code reviews** - All PRs require at least one approval before merging
- **CI/CD pipelines** - Automated testing, linting, and security scanning
- **Definition of Done** - Clear acceptance criteria for every feature
- **Pre-release validation** - Staging deployments and smoke tests before production
- **Rollback plans** - Documented mitigation strategies for every release
