# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Documentation Hub! This collection of guides provides comprehensive information about how we plan, execute, and deliver projects at OctoAcme. Whether you're a new teammate, stakeholder, or contributor, these documents will help you understand our project management processes, workflows, and best practices.

## Overview

At OctoAcme, we follow a customer-first, iterative approach to project management that emphasizes clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety. Our methodology is designed to support cross-functional teams delivering product features, services, and integrations efficiently and reliably. Each project follows a structured lifecycle from initiation through deployment and continuous improvement, ensuring that we maintain high quality standards while adapting to changing requirements and feedback.

Our project management framework is built on five core principles: prioritizing customer value and usability, delivering small testable increments, establishing clear ownership with named Project Managers and Product Leads, making data-informed decisions by measuring impact, and fostering psychological safety to encourage feedback and learning. These principles guide every project and inform the processes documented here.

The project lifecycle at OctoAcme consists of five key phases: Initiation (defining problem statements, stakeholders, and high-level timelines), Planning (scoping, resourcing, and identifying dependencies), Execution (building, testing, and iterating), Release (deploying and verifying), and Retrospective (capturing learnings and defining next steps). Throughout this lifecycle, we maintain regular communication cadences including weekly PM-PdM syncs, twice-weekly team standups, and monthly stakeholder updates.

Quality assurance is integrated throughout our processes, from defining acceptance criteria during planning to running automated tests during execution, conducting manual QA before release, and performing post-deployment smoke tests. We manage risks proactively through risk registers, track dependencies across teams, and maintain clear escalation paths. Our communication strategies ensure transparency across all stakeholder groups, with consistent status reporting, single sources of truth for project information, and structured templates for weekly updates and incident communications.

## Getting Started

If you're new to project management at OctoAcme, we recommend reading the documents in this order:

1. Start with the **Project Management Overview** to understand our core principles and approach
2. Review **Roles and Personas** to understand team structure and responsibilities
3. Follow the lifecycle documents in sequence (**Initiation** → **Planning** → **Execution** → **Release** → **Retrospective**) to learn the end-to-end process
4. Reference **Risk Management & Communication** as needed throughout any project phase

For quick reference, each document includes checklists, templates, and practical examples you can adapt for your specific project needs.
